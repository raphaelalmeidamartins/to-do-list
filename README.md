## :page_with_curl: About

Project of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript developed by me ([Raphael Martins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaelameidamartins/)) at the end of Unit 5 ([Principles of Web Development Module](https://github.com/raphaelalmeidamartins/trybe_exercicios/tree/main/1_fundamentos-do-desv-web)) of [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com)'s Web Development course. I was approved with 100% of the mandatory and optional requirements met.

We developed a dynamic and interactive web page with a to-do list application. The user can change the order of the list items, mark them as completed, or delete them. It's also possible to save the list, so when the user enters the page again, it is the same way as it was left.
